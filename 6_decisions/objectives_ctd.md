## Understanding Logic-Planning Tools and Decision Making

-   Pseudocode
    A tool that helps programmers plan a program's logic by writing plain English statements
-   Flowchart
    You write steps in diagram form as a series of shapes connected by arrows
-   Sequence structure
    One step follows another unconditionally and sequentially
    Sometimes, logical steps do not follow in an unconditional sequence
-   Decision structure
    Involves choosing between alternative courses of action based on some value within a program
    All computer decisions are yes-or-no decisions when reduced to their most basic form

## Making Decisions Using if Statement

-   if statement
    Used to make a single-alternative decision
-   Block
    One or more statements contained within a pair of curly braces
