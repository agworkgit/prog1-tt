## Understanding Logic-Planning Tools and Decision Making

-   Pseudocode
    A tool that helps programmers plan a program's logic by writing plain English statements
-   Flowchart
    You write steps in diagram form as a series of shapes connected by arrows
-   Sequence structure
    One step follows another unconditionally and sequentially
    Sometimes, logical steps do not follow in an unconditional sequence
-   Decision structure
    Involves choosing between alternative courses of action based on some value within a program
    All computer decisions are yes-or-no decisions when reduced to their most basic form

## Making Decisions Using if Statement

-   if statement
    Used to make a single-alternative decision
-   Block
    One or more statements contained within a pair of curly braces

## Nested if

-   One decision structure, or if statement that is contained within another
-   Decision strucutres can be nested to multiple levels
-   If an outer level if statement fails or retuns a false result, all inner blocks of code are ignored
-   Creating too many levels can result in code that is difficult to understand and maintain

## Making Decisions Using if/else Statement

-   Dual-alternative decisions
    Have two possible outcomes
-   if-else statement
    Used to perform one acion when Boolean expression evaluates to true, and an alternative action whe it evaluates to false
