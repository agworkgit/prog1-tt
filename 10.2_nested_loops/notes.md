## Using nested loops

-   When loops are nested, each pair contains an inner loop and an outer loop
    a. The inner loop must be entirely contaioned within the outer loop
    b. Loops can never overlap
-   We use nested loops to test for multiple conditions at the same time
    a. An example is navigating through a table with (n) rows by (n) columns or a chess board (8x8)
