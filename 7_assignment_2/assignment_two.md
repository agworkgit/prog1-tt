# Assignment two

1. Write a console-based program that accepts a user's message and determines whether it is short enough for a social networking service that does not accept messages of more than 140 characters. The program should provide output that tells the user if the message is accepted or not. [Hint: if the user's input is assigned to the variable message then message.Length will provide the number of characters in the input] (4 Marks: Functionality).

2. Write a console-based program for a college's admissions office. The user enters a numeric high school grade point average (for example, 3.2) and an admission test score. Display the message
   "Accept" if the student meets either of the following requirements (6 Marks: Functionality):
   a. A grade point average of 3.0 or higher and an admission test score of at least 60
   b. A grade point average of less than 3.0 and an admission test score of at least 80
   c. If the student does not meet either of the qualification criteria, display "Reject".

3. Write a console-based program that prompts the user for an hourly pay rate and hours worked.
   Compute gross pay (hours times pay rate), withholding tax, and net pay (gross pay minus withholding tax). Withholding tax is computed as a percentage of gross pay based on the following (7 Marks: Functionality):

Gross Pay / Withholding Percentage
Up to and including 300.00 / 10%
More than 300.00 / 12%

4. Write a console-based program for a lawn-mowing service. The lawn-mowing season lasts 20 weeks. The weekly fee for mowing a lot under 400 square feet is $25. The fee for a lot that is 400 square feet or more, but under 600 square feet, is $35 per week. The fee for a lot that is 600 square feet or over is $50 per week. Prompt the user for the length and width of a lawn, and then display the weekly mowing fee, as well as the total fee for the 20-week season. (6 Marks: Functionality).

5. To the Lawn application you created in the above question, add a prompt that asks the user whether the customer wants to pay (1) once, (2) twice, or (3) 20 times per season. If the user enters 1 for once, the fee for the season is simply the seasonal total. If the customer requests two payments, each payment is half the seasonal fee plus a $5 service charge. If the user requests 20 separate payments, add a $3 service charge per week. Display the number of payments the customer must make, each payment amount, and the total for the season. (7 Marks: Functionality).
